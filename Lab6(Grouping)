There is circumstance when we apply aggregate function not only to single set of tuple(row) but also to group of sets of tuples we specify this wish in SQL using 
group by clause. Attribute given in the group clause are used to form a group.
In grouping, we use having keyword rather than where for condition because we are applying conditions to whole set of tuples .

Syntax-> select columnname, columnname from tablename Group By columnname Having searchcondition.

Ans1) select pm.description,sum(so.Qty_disp) from product_master as pm,sales_order_details as so where pm.product_no=so.Product_no group by pm.description;
Ans2) select so.Product_no,pm.description,sum(so.Qty_disp*so.Product_rate) from product_master as pm,sales_order_details as so where pm.product_no=so.Product_no  
      group by pm.description;
