                                                                       Joins 

Sometimes we require to treat more than one table so to achieve it we can use join.
joins on the bases of that column that have same data type and data in the tables.
table that have to join comes in from clause
and condition in where clause.
Algo of join in sql-->    cartesian product (select * from Emp,Dep) + some condition (where D_name='HR')
                          select * from Emp,Dep where D_name='HR';


Natural Join-> Whe n we have to equalise the value of common attribute in both the table. For ex find the name of employee who is woring in the HR department.

Self Join->   Table join with itself . we create a replica of the same table and then apply conditions. For example find the student who is enrolled in more than one 
              courses.
              Table of student->    s_id     |   c_id   |   Since
                                   s1        |    C1    | 2016  
                                   s2        |    C2    | 2016
                                   s1        |    C2    | 2016
               Ques-> Find the student who is enroll in more than one subject.
               Ans-> select T1.s_id,T1.c_id from student as T1, student as T2 where T1.s_id=T2.s_id and T1.c_id<> T2.c_id; 

Left Outer join-> Natural join + data which is in the left.It gives the matching row and the rows which are in left table but not in right table.
                               Left table           Right table
                                 |                   |
                                 V                   V
                  select * from Emp left outer join Dep on (Emp.Dept_no=Dep.Dept_no);

Right Outer join->  Natural Join + Right table data.
                    select * from Emp right outer join Dep on (Emp.dept_no=Dep.dept_no);
                    
Full Outer join->   Union of left outer + Right outer.
