numeric datatype-> decimal(10,2)  //gives output after decimal upto 2 value
create table tablename(name varchar(50));
insert into table_name values('Chirag');
In()->                      In operator is used to determine the speicific value in a set.-> select * from table_name where city IN('Bombay','China');
Not in()->                  functoin makes sure that the expression proceeded does not have any of the values present in the argument.
order by ->                 keyword which sort the result-set in ascending order or descending order. //select * from table_name order by column_name asc/desc.
                            print the output by price*15 as new_price-> select sell_price*15 as new_price from table_name;
update ->                   update table_name set sell_price=150 where value=180;
delete ->                   delete from table_name where 
Like->                      like operator is used where we want to follow the specofoc pattern in a column. select name from client_master where city Like '_a%';
Aggerate function->         performing calculations on multiple rows of a single column and returing a single value. 5 fx. (count,sum,avg,min,max)
                            select min(sell_price) as min_price from product_master

How to define Primary Key-> Which uniquely defines the record in table.
                            It must contains the unique and not null value.
                            Syntax->  Column_name varchar(50) Primary Key Not Null.
                            
How to define Foreign Key-> basicaly used to link two tables.
                            Foreign key is a field in one table that refers to primary key of another table.
                            table containing foreign key is child key and another table is referenced or parent key.
                            If any record in referenced table (i.e. the table who contain primary key) is deleted, all the corresponding records in the 
                            referencing table will be deleted for the referential integrity. 
                            Syntax-> id int references CLient_master(roll),  //dono ka datatype same hai
                            
Referntial integrity->      Concept in a database that is used to build and maintain logical relationship between tables .
                            The main concept is that it does not allow to add any record in a table that contains the foreign key  
                            
Data Constraint->           restriction over the table
                            limit the type of data which can go in the table
                            This ensure the accuracy and reliablity of the data in databse.
                            1) Not null -> ensure that column can not have null values                          // Not NULL
                            2) Default-> provide the null value for a column when none value is specified.      // Default 'F'
                            3) Unique-> ensures that all values are different                                   // id Unique Not NULL(Better use Primary Key)
                            4) Primary Key-> uniqely identify each row/record in table.                         // Primary Key
                            5) Check-> all the value in the column satisfy certain conditions.                  // check(Sales_man Like 'S%'), 
                                                                                                                   check(Sales_man >0), 
                                                                                                                   check(Sales_man IN('MAN','Women')), 
                                                                                                                   check(Sales_man Not In('F'))
                            6) index-> used to create and retrive data from the database very quickly.
                            
alter->                     modify to tables structure.
                            can drop ,add or postioning of column
                            Drop a column->           alter table table_name drop column_name;
                            Add a column->            alter table table_name ADD EMP_ID int;
                            Add column after that->   alter table table_name add emp_id int after roll;
                            Modify ->                 alter table table_name modify column_name varchar(30);
                            Table name changed->      alter table practice to practice2;
                            Rename column->           alter table practice rename column id to roll;
                            Add Primary key->         alter table practice add primary key(roll_no);
                            Add Foreign Key->         alter table practice add constraints ck Foreign Key(column_name)  references  Client_master(client_no);
                            Drop Primary Key->        alter table practice drop primary key;
                            Drop Foreign KEy->        alter table practice drop Constraint CK;// constraint name.
                            
drop table->                drop table table_name.
