Data->          Data is basically fact about the entity(real world object) that are recorded means that are stored somewhere. For example if we write in  notebook 
                this is also data.
Information->   The data which is useful to you at that time is information
Example->       If we find the location of train. Than we go into the railway portal and find the location of train. That is info rest all the details showing in 
                portal is data.
                
Database->      Database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can easily be accessed, managed or updated.

Meta-data->     Data about data. Like in which location file is present.

Attributes->    meta-data. Data required before creating the table like (Name, Location).

File V/S DBMS->                           FILE                       |            DBMS
                            1) Slow                                  | 1) Searching is fast
                            2) Meta-data required                    | 2) Meta-data is not required before searching any information.
                            3) Not efficient                         | 3) Memory Utilization is efficient.
                            4) No such protocol                      | 4) Lots of Constraint for data redundancy like Primary key Constraint.
                            5) No role based control                 | 5) Role based access control security protocol is implemented.
                            6) No security protocols.(Only login id, | 6) Security protocols are implemented.
                            pass is required to login)               |

Redundancy->    Duplicacy of data

Concurrency->   At a single time, multiple person can access the data.

Schema->        Logical representaion of database.

numeric datatype-> decimal(10,2)  //gives output after decimal upto 2 value
create table tablename(name varchar(50));
insert into table_name values('Chirag');

In()->                      In operator is used to determine the speicific value in a set.-> select * from table_name where city IN('Bombay','China');

Not in()->                  functoin makes sure that the expression proceeded does not have any of the values present in the argument.

order by ->                 keyword which sort the result-set in ascending order or descending order. //select * from table_name order by column_name asc/desc.
                            print the output by price*15 as new_price-> select sell_price*15 as new_price from table_name;

update ->                   update table_name set sell_price=150 where value=180;

delete ->                   delete from table_name where 

Like->                      like operator is used where we want to follow the specofoc pattern in a column. select name from client_master where city Like '_a%';

Between ->                  between operator selects a value with in the range. Between operator are inclusive. Both starting and end value are inclusive.

Aggerate function->         performing calculations on multiple rows of a single column and returing a single value. 5 fx. (count,sum,avg,min,max)
                            select min(sell_price) as min_price from product_master

How to define Primary Key-> Which uniquely defines the record in table.
                            It must contains the unique and not null value.
                            Syntax->  Column_name varchar(50) Primary Key Not Null.
                            
How to define Foreign Key-> basicaly used to link two tables.
                            Foreign key is a field in one table that refers to primary key of another table.
                            table containing foreign key is child key and another table is referenced or parent key.
                            If any record in referenced table (i.e. the table who contain primary key) is deleted, all the corresponding records in the 
                            referencing table will be deleted for the referential integrity. 
                            Syntax-> id int references CLient_master(roll),  //dono ka datatype same hai
                            
Referntial integrity->      Concept in a database that is used to build and maintain logical relationship between tables .
                            The main concept is that it does not allow to add any record in a table that contains the foreign key  
                            
Data Constraint->           restriction over the table
                            limit the type of data which can go in the table
                            This ensure the accuracy and reliablity of the data in databse.
                            1) Not null -> ensure that column can not have null values                          // Not NULL
                            2) Default-> provide the null value for a column when none value is specified.      // Default 'F'
                            3) Unique-> ensures that all values are different                                   // id Unique Not NULL(Better use Primary Key)
                            4) Primary Key-> uniqely identify each row/record in table.                         // Primary Key
                            5) Check-> all the value in the column satisfy certain conditions.                  // check(Sales_man Like 'S%'), 
                                                                                                                   check(Sales_man >0), 
                                                                                                                   check(Sales_man IN('MAN','Women')), 
                                                                                                                   check(Sales_man Not In('F'))
                            6) index-> used to create and retrive data from the database very quickly.
                            
alter->                     modify to tables structure.
                            can drop ,add or postioning of column
                            Drop a column->           alter table table_name drop column_name;
                            Add a column->            alter table table_name ADD EMP_ID int;
                            Add column after that->   alter table table_name add emp_id int after roll;
                            Modify ->                 alter table table_name modify column_name varchar(30);
                            Table name changed->      alter table practice to practice2;
                            Rename column->           alter table practice rename column id to roll;
                            Add Primary key->         alter table practice add primary key(roll_no);
                            Add Foreign Key->         alter table practice add constraints ck Foreign Key(column_name)  references  Client_master(client_no);
                            Drop Primary Key->        alter table practice drop primary key;
                            Drop Foreign KEy->        alter table practice drop Constraint CK;// constraint name.
                            
drop table->                drop table table_name.


Difference B/w Delete, Drop, Truncate
                                            Delete                                |         Drop                                   |      Truncate  
                            1) Used when we want to delete row of table.          |   1) used when we want to delete whole table   |  1) Same as we use delete command as

                            4) If we delete particular row than we can Use        |   4) We can not rollback.                      |  2) Faster than delete.

                            5) We can rollback.(Logs are maintained in it.)       |                                                |  4) We can not rollback.

Note:
1) There is only one primary key in a table as it will form clustered index.
2) 

Transaction -> means any change in the database.
ACID property-> Atomicity means either entire transaction takes place or nothing will take place.
                Consistency-> means data must be consistence before and after the transaction.
                Isolation -> multipe transaction can occur withour interpting the other one.
                Durablility-> all the changes which are done is permanently stored in database.
                
Normalization-> technique used to reduce a redundancy in a table.
                1NF.
                2NF-> Partial dependency not allowed means Non prime attributes should not be a part of CK.
                3NF-> 2NF+Transitive depandency not allowed. means non prime atribute should not depend upon non prime value.
                BCNF(BoyCode normal form) 3NF+ Left side must be super key.
