Index-> Database index is a data structure that improves the speed of operations in a table. Practically, indexes are also a type of table, which keep a primary key 
        and pointer to each record in the actual table.
        The insert and the update queries take time on the table having indexes whereas select statement becomes fast on those tables. The reason is that while doing 
        insert or update , a database needs to insert or update the index values as well.
